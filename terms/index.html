        <li>Due to the nature of our financing, we are unable to offer withdrawals. <u>Please only top up the amount you intend on spending.</u></li>
        <li>Under exceptional circumstances where we deem a refund justifiable, this will be in the form of credit added to your bithost account only.</li>
